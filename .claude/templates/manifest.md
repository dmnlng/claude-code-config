## Feature Development Workflow

This project uses **SpecFlow** for feature development:

### Creating a New Feature
```bash
/feature "Feature description"
```

This will guide you through:
1. **Ideation**: Gather requirements and create spec
2. **Gap Analysis**: Identify spec gaps and conflicts
3. **Planning**: Create technical design
4. **Task Breakdown**: Generate TDD-focused task list (RED ‚Üí GREEN ‚Üí REFACTOR)
5. **Implementation**: Follow task list
6. **Verification**: Run `/feature verify {feature-id}`

### Verifying Implementation
```bash
/feature verify {feature-id}
```

Verification checks:
- Task completion (20% weight)
- Test coverage (20% weight)
- Functional requirements (15% weight)
- Non-functional requirements (15% weight)
- Success criteria (10% weight)
- Manifest alignment (10% weight)
- Code quality (5% weight)
- Documentation (5% weight)

**Pass Criteria:** ‚â•80/100 overall score, all critical requirements met

### Updating Manifest
When a feature is verified and merged, update this manifest:

```bash
/manifest update
```

Mark the feature as complete:
```markdown
- [X] Feature Name (feature-id) ‚úÖ Completed {DATE}
```
