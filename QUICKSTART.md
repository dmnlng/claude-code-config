# Quick Start - 2 Steps Only!

## Step 1: Install

```bash
cd your-project
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dmnlng/claude-code-config/main/install.sh | bash
```

Wait for installation to complete (~30 seconds).

## Step 2: Restart Claude

```bash
# Exit (Ctrl+C)
^C

# Restart
claude

# Verify it works
> /doctor
```

**Expected output:**
```
âœ… settings.local.json
âœ… validate-bash.sh
âœ… .claude/ignore
âœ… CLAUDE.md
âœ… Bash validation hook active
âœ… Token optimization working

Status: ðŸŸ¢ ALL SYSTEMS GO
```

## Done! ðŸŽ‰

You just saved ~82% tokens per session.

**Try these:**
```bash
> /test              # Run your tests
> /review src/       # Code review
> /compliance        # See your score
```

## Optional: Customize

Want to configure workflows, MCP servers, or team settings?

```bash
> /init
```

This will guide you through:
- Enabling workflow guides (TDD, Visual, Multi-Claude)
- Setting up MCP integrations
- Customizing CLAUDE.md for your team
- Creating a git commit

---

## Optional: Feature Development with SpecFlow

Want structured feature development with specs, TDD, and verification?

**Step 1: Create project manifest (once):**
```bash
> /manifest init
```

Answer a few questions to create `manifest.md` - your project's constitution.

**Step 2: Create a feature:**
```bash
> /feature "Add user authentication"
```

SpecFlow guides you through:
1. Spec creation (requirements, user stories, success criteria)
2. Gap analysis (catches missing requirements)
3. Technical planning (architecture, test strategy)
4. Task breakdown (RED â†’ GREEN â†’ REFACTOR)
5. Implementation and verification

**Step 3: Verify when done:**
```bash
> /feature verify 001-user-auth
```

Gets scored 0-100 with APPROVED/REJECTED status.

**Why use SpecFlow?**
- âœ… Clear requirements before coding
- âœ… TDD-enforced (write tests first)
- âœ… Catches spec gaps early
- âœ… Comprehensive verification
- âœ… Less rework, fewer bugs

**Learn more:** See "SpecFlow" section in README.md

## What Just Happened?

The install script:
1. Downloaded the template from GitHub
2. Auto-detected your project type (JS/Python/Rust/etc.)
3. Installed all configuration files
4. Set up token optimization hooks
5. Customized CLAUDE.md for your stack

**Result:** Claude now skips `node_modules/`, `.git/`, `dist/`, etc.
